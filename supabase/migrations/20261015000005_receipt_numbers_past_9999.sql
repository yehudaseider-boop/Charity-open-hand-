-- Givezy: code review fixes, receipts (15/10/2026).
-- Receipt references printed only 4 digits: Postgres's lpad cuts longer text, so a charity's 10 000th
-- receipt printed as "-1000", the same as its 1 000th. The number itself was always unique (charity,
-- receipt_number); only the printed reference repeated. Numbers now print in full: 0001 ... 9999, 10000.
-- Same function as 20261009000008_receipt_identity.sql with that one line changed.
