-- Givezy: dedications (15/10/2026, approved by Yehuda).
-- A donor may give "in honour of" or "in memory of" someone. Only the kind and the name are stored
-- (the optional note to the charity is the donation's existing message). The donor and the charity
-- see it; it is never on an s18A receipt; erasing the donor's information wipes it.

-- 1. The dedication on a donation, and on a monthly donation (copied to each month's donation).
alter table public.donations
  add column dedication_kind text,
  add column dedication_name text,
  add constraint dedication_kind_known check (dedication_kind in ('honour', 'memory')),
  add constraint dedication_name_length check (dedication_name is null or char_length(dedication_name) between 1 and 80),
  add constraint dedication_complete check ((dedication_kind is null) = (dedication_name is null));

alter table public.recurring_donations
  add column dedication_kind text,
  add column dedication_name text,
  add constraint dedication_kind_known check (dedication_kind in ('honour', 'memory')),
  add constraint dedication_name_length check (dedication_name is null or char_length(dedication_name) between 1 and 80),
  add constraint dedication_complete check ((dedication_kind is null) = (dedication_name is null));

-- 2. Charities see the dedication on their donations (new columns go at the end of the view).

  select
