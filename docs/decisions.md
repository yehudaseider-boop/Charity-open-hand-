# Decisions and open questions

## Decided

- **Stack:** Next.js 16 + TypeScript, Supabase (Postgres, auth, storage), Vitest.
  Hosting: Vercel. Email: Resend (behind an adapter). PDFs: HTML printed by
  headless Chrome, because simpler PDF libraries break Hebrew right-to-left text.
- **Money:** integer cents in ZAR (`bigint`). Percentages stored as integer
  parts-per-million (3% = 30000) so fee maths never touches floating point.
- **Tax year naming:** SARS convention, named by the year it ends.
  Tax year 2027 = 01/03/2026 to 28/02/2027. Calculated in the app from config,
  in Johannesburg time.
- **Split always adds up:** the database refuses any donation where
  gift + platform fee + VAT on fee + gateway charge does not equal the total charged.
- **Receipts:** sequential per charity, immutable once issued, void keeps the
  row and needs a reason, never deleted, one issued receipt per donor per charity
  per tax year.

## Changes from the brief's starting data model

- `users` became `profiles` (Supabase already has an auth users table).
  Platform admin is a role on the profile; charity admin is a membership in
  `charity_admins`, so one person can be both a donor and a charity admin.
- Charity bank and contact details moved to `charity_private`, so the public
  directory can never expose them.
- The donor's private note moved to `donation_private_notes`, so charities can
  never read it, even by accident.
- Maaser, favourites and "given elsewhere" are keyed by account (`user_id`),
  not donor identity, because only account holders get them.
- A donor identity is per email + type, so one person can give as an
  individual and as their company and receive separate receipts.
- `donor_type` includes `trust`, because the SARS receipt fields list
  individual, company and trust.
- `donations.funding_source` is `card` only for now. A future wallet adds a
  `wallet` value and separate double-entry tables without changing this one.
- `gateway_events` stores every webhook once, for idempotency.

## Open (ask Yehuda when reached)

1. Gateway choice and rate sheet (percentage + fixed charge). Fields are empty.
2. Whether the processing fee shown to donors includes VAT once VAT-registered.
3. Platform name, domain, logo and colours.
4. Rounding rule for fees (proposed at milestone 3).
5. Supabase has no South African region; POPIA cross-border transfer for the attorney.
